PROBLEM STATEMENT :
The intersection of roads of almost every metropolitan city has a traffic light. In automated Traffic Control System there is a need to contineously monitor the number of waiting and incoming vehicles for the smooth functioning of the entire system. This monitoring process can me made significantly easy with a fuzzy logic that would give an idea about the status of the traffic to the system using which the system with the help of other algorithms can find out after how much time the lights must go red or green.


REQUIREMENTS:
Python 3.8 and above (any 3.x should be fine)
Modules of python :-
       1. Scikit_fuzzy :< $pip install scikit-fuzzy >
       2. Tkinter      :COMES BUILDIN WITH PYTHON 3.X
       3. Matplotlib    

USAGE :
In the directory of the folder open CMD/terminal and <  $ python traffic.py >

The above program uses Tkinter that takes the input from the user for easy usage, however in practical situation it must me fed with large set of input from Image Dectector that monitors the intersection using sensors and cameras.

Input 1. Cars Incoming
      2. Cars Waiting
